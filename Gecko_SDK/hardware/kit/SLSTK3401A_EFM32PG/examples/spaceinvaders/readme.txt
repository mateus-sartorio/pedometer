Space Invaders game using the Memory LCD on the SLSTK3401A.

This example project uses the EFM32 CMSIS including emlib and the
board support package support functions/drivers to demonstrate driving
the Sharp Memory LCD display on the SLSTK3401A Starter Kit.

Game instructions are displayed on the startup screen.

For debug builds the game may run slow because they are not optimized
for speed. The user should build and run the release builds for
optimized performance.
