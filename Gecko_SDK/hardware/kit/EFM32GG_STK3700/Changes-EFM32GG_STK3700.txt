================ Revision history ============================================
5.0.0:
- Added FreeRTOS Demo.
- Added leuart example.

4.4.0:
- New USB examples using new USBXpress library.
- New Capacitive Sense example using the new cap sense library (cslib).
- uC/OS-II example switch from using mailbox to using a queue to send
  characters from the serial port to the display. Using a mailbox could lead
  to characters dropped when typing fast.

4.3.1:
- No changes.

4.3.0:
- Fixed RTC and BURTC bug in FreeRTOS examples. RTC and BURTC counter was reset
  before the counter value was read, leading to incorrect sleep durations.
- uC/OS-III example now enables the statistics task by default, which makes
  stack usage available in the IAR uC/OS-III plugin.
- Fixed ucos examples, drop fewer chars when doing "console" input.
- Added cpt007b capacitive touch example.

4.2.1:
- Made changes to segmentlcdconfig.h file

4.2.0:
- No changes.

4.1.1:
- No changes.
