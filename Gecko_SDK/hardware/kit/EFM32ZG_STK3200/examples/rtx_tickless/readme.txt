Keil RTX RTOS - tick-less example

This example project uses the Keil RTX RTOS, and gives a basic demonstration
of one task that displays pictures on memory LCD and main task that
periodically refresh it. The RTX is configured in tick-less mode, going into 
EM2 when no tasks are active. This example is intended as a skeleton for new 
projects using Keil RTX for energy aware applications.
