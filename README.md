# Pedometer

A pedometer is an instrument that counts a person's steps. There are different ways to build one, depending on the sensor. Contact sensors on the sole, piezoelectric sensors, among others, can be used. In this project, a three-axis accelerometer will be used.

This work was developed for the Embedded Systems II course in the Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- When changing the dApp address in the settings page, the Front End continues to use the default address. This happens because the address configuration page and the input submission page are separate, and to share state between two pages in React, you need to set up a Redux store, which hasn't been done in the project.


## üêû Known bugs

- Sometimes the reference to the MetaMask wallet is lost in the application (for unknown reasons), and the user needs to log out and log back in to continue.

- Sometimes, when logging out, an error is thrown, and the user needs to navigate to the `/` route to log in again.
